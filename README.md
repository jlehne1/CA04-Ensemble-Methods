# CA04-Ensemble-Methods

This repository contains all the material needed for CA04 about ensemble methods.  Specifically, there is a single folder that contains the code and responses for the assignment.

Data for this assignment is the same as CA03, and the link to the data can be found in-line in the code.  

CA04 covers ensemble methods.  The assignment asks us to code mutliple models including: Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting.  The first part of the assignment is to see how accuracy changes within each model given a change in the number of estimators (n_estimators). The final part of the assignment is to use a common set of hyper-parmeters in order to determine which model has the highest accuracy and AUC given the hyper-parameters.  The final output will be a table showcasing the final results along with a list of the common hyper-parameters.
